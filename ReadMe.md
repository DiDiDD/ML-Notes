# Machine Learning Notes Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Notes Repository**! This repository contains some useful notes and resources that I have curated while exploring various aspects of machine learning, with a particular focus on:

- **PyTorch Framework**: Notes and examples for deep learning using PyTorch, including model implementation, training, testing and other useful tools.
- **Model Acceleration**: Methods and strategies for optimizing machine learning models for faster inference and training, such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation.
- **AIGC for Computer Vision (AIGC_CV)**: Insights and developments in AI-generated content (AIGC) for computer vision applications, including generative models, image synthesis, and other cutting-edge techniques.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections:

### 1. PyTorch Framework
- Implementation of common neural network architectures.
- Training workflows with data loaders, optimizers, and loss functions.

### 2. Model Acceleration
- Notes on quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation.
- Tips for using hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs.
- Tools and libraries for model acceleration.

### 3. AIGC for Computer Vision
- Overview of generative models (e.g., GANs, VAEs, diffusion models).
- Applications in image synthesis, editing, and enhancement.
- Tutorials on using popular libraries for AIGC.
